* Project description:
  * Processed past 10 years financial data from Yahoo Finance to extract technical indicator features such as RSI,
MASI, and EMA. This project focuses on predicting stock price trend for a company in near future.

  * The prepared dataset looks like the figure shown below .

  * Proposed Methods:
    * Linear Regression
    * Regression using SVM
    * ANN Regression
    
  * Created Indictor functions:
  
    * Technical indicators use statistical properties of the present and previous samples, so it can be considered as more           related feature as it becomes easy to uptrend and downtrend.
    
    * Technical indicators used:
      * Money Flow Index (MFI)
      * Relative Strength Index (RSI)

      * Exponential Moving average (EMI)
      * Stochastic Oscillator (SO)
      
  * Evaluated extensive comparisons among the metrics MSE, MAE, and percentage error.
  
  * Implemented different models such as linear regression, support vector regression and ANN.
  * Achieved error rate as low as 0.64% using support vector regression in NIFTY index prediction.
