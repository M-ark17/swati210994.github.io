This talk presents an overview of the domain of deep learning. 
* Explored the design principles and difficulties in training large scale deep neural networks such as initialisation
strategy, batch normalisation, dropout and residual connection.
* Implemented activation functions such as sigmoid and ReLU along with hyper-parameter tuning.
* Evaluated loss functions such as cross entropy, weighted cross entropy, dice, inverse dice and focal loss with
corresponding changes in the output.
