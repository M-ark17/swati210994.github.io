This project is based on recognizing potholes and avoiding road accidents.
* Project description:
  * Implemented semantic segmentation network to recognize pothole to avoid road accidents. Performed data
  preprocessing using image labeler tool in MATLAB for pixel level classification.
  * Trained the network with 240 images and extensive comparisons with techniques such as edge detection and
  thresholding on dataset images. Achieved validation accuracy of 62.5%.
