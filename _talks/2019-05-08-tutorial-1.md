This is a joint talk by Prof. Amit Sethi and me. The agenda of the talk was to demonstrate some areas in the domain of electrical engineering where deep learning can be used as a computational tool. We presented some interesting use-cases like computation of fields in a complex environment, load prediction in grids, identification of modulations in channels, and some computer vision tasks.
